This is a short note of steps to follow when doing a machine learning project.

## Main steps

In a machine learning (ML) project, we work normally within 7 follwing steps:
- Step 1: **Gather the data**.
- Step 2: **Prepare the data** including dealing with *missing values* and *categorical data*.
- Step 3: **Select the model** there are many types of model can be applied in a machine learning project. It depends on the problem and the objective of your project. When we get started, we should try all possible models to see wether which one gives the most efficient result as we desire.
- Step 4: **Train the model** fit the model chosen with the training data.
- Step 5: **Evaluate the model** use the *validation set* to evaluate how well our model fits with the unseen data.
- Step 6: **Tune parameters** tune the model's parameters to get better performance. A method usually used is [XGBoost](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/xgboost).
- Step 7: **Get predictions** generate the trained model to get the predictions for the *test set*. 



## Prepare the data: Dealing with missing data and categorical data
  ### Missing data
  ### Categorical data

## Tune parameters
  ### XGBoost - Extreme gradient boost
  The XGBoost libary is usually used for working with standard tabular data such as data stored in the Pandas DataFrames, opposed to more exotic types of data like videos or images.
