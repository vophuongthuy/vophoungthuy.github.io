While Bootstrap uses ems or rems for defining most sizes, pxs are used for grid breakpoints and container widths. This is because the viewport width is in pixels and does not change with the font size.

See how aspects of the Bootstrap grid system work across multiple devices with a handy table.

$$
\begin{align}
 a + \sqrt{x^2} = 2.
\end{align}
$$

For some reason that is so far beyond me I can't even fathom how the decision was made, you can't count, increment or do any real math in Liquid. Sure, whatever. 

However, you are able to manipulate strings really well, so here's what I did to count search results that were grouped, thus preventing me from using {{search.results.count}} straight up.

I use a prefix in the handle to segment the search results. The trick is to append chars to an initially zero-length string, then get the 'size' of the string when you're done.
