subtitle: Without you, I cannot achieve this site

I cannot build this site by myself from scratch. Many thanks to [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/) with his [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme, I am able to get a general code for the layout and the idea of designing.

Of course, without the help of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), you cannot see this site on the internet. I also use a lot of frameworks to make it more beautiful, let me say thanks to

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) version 3.3.2 for all its useful components.
- [SrPatinhas](https://bootsnipp.com/SrPatinhas) for the [timeline of status](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/timeline-21-with-images-and-responsive).
- Beautiful photos for covers, images,... from [Unspash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).
- Contact form design idea, thanks to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), [evarevirus](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/7KmBe) and [Brian Chu](http://www.brianchu.com/blog/2013/11/02/creating-an-auto-growing-text-input/).
- [Simple Responsive Timeline](https://codepen.io/brady_wright/pen/NNOvrW) by Brady Wright for the activity section.
- [Random posts during each page load on jekyll](https://thornelabs.net/2014/01/19/display-random-jekyll-posts-during-each-page-load-or-refresh-using-javascript.html) with the help of javascript thanks to ThroneLabs.
